PokeSmash - A Drunk Wager Taken Too Far
Developed by Elliott Black
@taargle

This is a website that uses jQuery and the fantastic PokeAPI project (https://pokeapi.co) to present a user with two random pokemon and force them to pick one of them to "smash" in a similar vein to the (in)famous Markiplier Smash or Pass video. Sort of. I dunno. It's what we were watching when this manifested.

Features planned to be included are a "history" feature that logs past choices into localstorage and allows a user to view their shame, and a "share" button if I can figure out at least one social media API function before this ends. These and others might end up on the cutting room floor, but if not, you know where they came from!

This is not meant to be taken seriously. I don't know why someone thought it was a good idea to commission this, but I had fun making it, so who cares.
